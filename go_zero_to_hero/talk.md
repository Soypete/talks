## Part-1 Intro to Programming

* 1.1 Hello World
<!--- starting with hello world allows us to explain how go programs run. not how they compile, but how they run. We explain the main funtion, package declaration, and file oranization. This is the starting point for learning how to read code. --->

## Part-1 Intro to Programming

* 1.1 Hello World
* 1.2 Types
<!---
- types are how we store information
- we naturally understand that numbers are different than letters, which are different than words. In programing we have to learn to specify that.

## Part-2 Using the Command Line
<!--- they can probably write 90% of the code I write daily at work. but if you dig into the tutorial I have intentionally shielded them from the compiler and most of the go tooling. this is because for a first time
