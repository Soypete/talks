# How to use your data?
* Reports

* Bi/Data analysis
* risk analysis
* product use case

# Data Architecture as part of planning process
* What data is developed in each step?
* What are availability needs?
  - Does the product need to consume this data? 
  - Do other services need to consume this data? 
* Is it worth the storage cost?

# When can we use machine learning? 
* monitoring (kubernetes auto scale)
* forcasting (att example)
* Product enhancement (weave sentiment analysis)

# Where do we start?
* Pain points
