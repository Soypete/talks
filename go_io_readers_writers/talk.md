# Exploring Go's io.Reader and io.Writer Interfaces
Miriah Peterson

---
<!--- we need to understand how go manages bits --->

## Intro
- Brief overview of Go's I/O mechanisms
- Importance of io.Reader and io.Writer interfaces in Go
- Purpose of the talk: to explore top implementations, efficiencies, patterns, anti-patterns, and uses

---

## Basics of io.Reader and io.Writer
- Explanation of io.Reader and io.Writer interfaces
- How they are used in Go programming

---

## Readers
<!-- deep dive into into I/O writer for http, memory, db, channels, etc

- where does is write
- how does it write
- when does it block the garbage collector
- how do channels play in --->

> "The io package specifies the io.Reader interface, which represents the read end of a stream of data."

##  **File I/O**
   - Efficiency analysis
   - Common usage patterns
   - Anti-patterns to avoid

---
   
## **Network I/O (e.g., TCP/UDP)**
   - Performance considerations
   - Best practices for handling network I/O
   - Security considerations

---

## **Buffered I/O**
   - Advantages of buffering
   - When to use buffered I/O
   - Demo: comparing buffered vs. unbuffered performance

---

## **Concurrency and io.Pipe**
   - Using io.Pipe for inter-process communication
   - Concurrency patterns with io.Reader and io.Writer
   - Pitfalls in concurrent I/O operations

---

## Memory Profiling with pprof
- Introduction to pprof for memory profiling
- Setting up pprof in Go programs
- Demo: measuring memory usage of different io.Reader and io.Writer implementations

---

## Conclusion
- Recap of key points about io.Reader and io.Writer interfaces
- Best practices for efficient I/O in Go
- Resources for further learning

---

## Demo
<!--- benchmark of several functions with memory on/ maybe pprof --->
